# Smart_irrigation
automatic plant watering system
It will be useful for farmers as it will bring automation in the process of irrigation.
This system is implemented using ARDUINO and has following components:
1.BUZZER
2.PUMP
3.SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR
4.WATER LEVEL SENSOR
5.RELAY
6.BATTERY
In this system we have used two sensors:
1.Soil moisture sensor
2.Water level sensor
The soil moisture sensor and water level sensors will act as input.If the moisture in the soil is less than buzzer(output) will get switched ON to alert the farmer.If the water level in tank is more than or equal to required than the pump(output) will start fetching the water and the motor will start giving water to the plant. After the moisture content in the soil is retained then pump will be switched OFF automatically.
